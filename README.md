# **my-digital-garden**

> _"To unlock the mind and connect back to Self"_

A living, interactive space where I share who I am, what I think about, and what I'm building. My **digital garden**—built with intention.

---

## **The Vision**

Welcome to my digital garden—a space where I document my journey of becoming and of building.

---

## **Key Features**

### 🌸 **Interactive 3D Mind Garden**

A fully-rendered Three.js scene featuring:

- **Clickable red lighthouse** with rotating beacon (the lighthouse represents your life's purpose, your foundational mission that guides how you live/show up every day)
- **Fibonacci spiral flora**: 33 yellow roses, 70+ colorful flowers, trees, bushes, and grass—all positioned using the golden ratio
- **Animated ocean & mountains** with custom shaders
- **Living details**: butterflies, pollen particles, and 3,333 twinkling stars
- **Smooth day/night transitions** that transform the entire scene

### ⌨️ **Keyboard-Driven Navigation**

Built for flow-state exploration:

- **D/L**: Toggle dark ↔ light theme
- **A/J**: Previous page
- **S/K**: Next page

No mouse required. Just flow.

### 🎨 **Dual-Theme System**

Flexoki color palette with smooth transitions:

- **Dark mode**: Deep, contemplative blacks with warm accents
- **Light mode**: Paper-white warmth for daytime reading
- All elements transition smoothly—sky, ocean, plants, stars

### 📖 **Three Core Pages**

- **Home (Garden)**: 3D garden
- **My Story**: journey of becoming
- **Now (Ki)**: currently building

---

## **The Stack**

- **Next.js 15** + **React 19**
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **GSAP** for buttery animations
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + custom Flexoki theme
- **TypeScript** throughout

---

## **Design Philosophy**

### The Fibonacci Spiral

The garden follows the **golden angle (137.5°)**, the same pattern found in sunflowers, galaxies, and shells. Each plant is positioned mathematically, yet feels organic. Order within chaos. Structure within nature.

### The Lighthouse

The lighthouse is both anchor and beacon. Click it to reveal the core mission. Its light sweeps across the garden, pulsing brighter in darkness—always guiding, always present.

### The Day/Night Cycle

Press D (or L) and watch the world transform. The sky shifts through gradients, stars fade in, the ocean deepens, plants darken. An 800ms transition that feels like breathing.
