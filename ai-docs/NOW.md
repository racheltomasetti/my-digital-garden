Core Insights for NOW Page Project Structure
Overall Philosophy
The NOW page showcases the current state of thinking and building journey. It tells the story of a recent transformation: realizing that ideas stayed in the head without building, flipping the switch to build consistently, and experiencing astronomical learning and creative liberation in the past few weeks.
Key Narrative Points

The Shift: From not building → building consistently
The Result: Exponential learning, creative fire ignited
The Core Truth: Building digitally opens infinite possibilities - "I can build whatever the fuck I want"
The Connection: All projects are manifestations of the journey of Self

Page Structure (Top to Bottom)

Video Message - Personal introduction to the building journey
Hero/Philosophy - The manifesto about building, the transformation, the creative liberation
Projects Grid - Three equal-weight projects at different stages
Connect CTA - Existing section remains at bottom

Project Presentation Approach

Equal Weight: All three projects have equal importance, just at different stages
Stage Transparency: Show where each project is (Building/Research/Exploring)
Personal Connection: Each project connects to personal journey and transformation
Preview Cards: Brief hook on main page, click through for deep dive

Individual Project Page Structure
Each project gets dedicated page with consistent sections:

Video Message - Project-specific introduction
The Why - Personal connection, pain point, problem being solved
The What - Vision, what's being built, goals
The How - Tech stack + AI tools + workflow + process others can learn from
Current State - Progress, learnings, next steps
Visuals/Demos - Screenshots, demos when applicable

The "How" Section Philosophy
This is the most important differentiator. Show:

Tech Stack: What technologies are used
AI Tools: Which AI tools are in the workflow
Process Flow: How you move between tools to reach desired outcomes
Workflow Examples: Concrete step-by-step examples
System/Learnings: A system people can learn from, reflect on, and iterate on

The goal is transparency in the building process so others can understand and learn from the approach.
Three Projects

builder-ki - Extends the learning journey, helps builders synthesize context and build intentionally with AI (Stage: Building)
Menstrual Cycle Expert Assistant - Capstone project, deeply personal origin (Stage: Research)
Digital Garden - This site itself, sharing story and work (Stage: Building)

Navigation Philosophy

Main Pages: Arrow keys move between Home/Story/NOW
Project Pages: Arrow keys cycle between projects (builder-ki → cycle-assistant → digital-garden → builder-ki1. )
Each project page can navigate back to NOW or cycle to next/previous project

Design Principles

Unique Identity: Each project page has its own color theme/visual identity
Consistency: Maintain structure across all project pages
Breathing Room: Philosophy/manifesto sections need space and impact
Scrollability: Comfortable with longer scrolling pages for depth

Content Delivery Goals
People should leave:

Inspired to build - Feeling the creative energy and possibility
Understanding who you are - Full picture of journey, worldview, and work
With tangible learnings - Actual workflows and systems they can apply
