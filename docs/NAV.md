# Navigation Implementation for Ray's Garden

## Context

We're adding navigation to the 3D garden website. The site has three pages:

- Home (/) - The 3D garden landing page
- Story (/story) - Combined MY STORY and NOW page
- Connect (/connect) - Contact page

The navigation needs to work beautifully over the 3D scene and handle a special first-time visitor experience.

## Goal

Implement a navigation bar with a first-time visitor modal that guides users to start from the beginning of the story.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Navigation Component Structure

**File:** `app/components/Navigation.tsx`

**Layout:**

```
+------------------------------------------------+
| RAY'S GARDEN          MY STORY  NOW  CONNECT   |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

**Desktop:**

- Left: "RAY'S GARDEN" (links to /)
- Right: "MY STORY", "NOW", "CONNECT" (horizontal links)

**Mobile (< 768px):**

- Left: "RAY'S GARDEN"
- Right: Hamburger menu (☰)
- When open: Links stack vertically below

### 2. Navigation Styling

**Background:** Use backdrop blur with subtle transparency

```typescript
className = "bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md";
```

**Why blur over transparent:**

- Maintains readability over complex 3D scene
- Creates visual separation without blocking the garden
- Modern, polished look
- Text remains readable as scene animates behind it

**Color scheme:**

- Text: White (`text-white`)
- Hover: Slightly dimmed white (`hover:text-white/80`)
- Background: Very subtle white with blur
- Semi-transparent so garden shows through

**Typography:**

- "RAY'S GARDEN": Larger, bold (text-2xl font-bold)
- Links: Normal weight, good spacing (gap-8)

### 3. Routing Structure

**Links:**

- "RAY'S GARDEN" → `/` (home)
- "MY STORY" → `/story#bottom` (triggers modal on first visit, then goes to bottom)
- "NOW" → `/story#top` (goes to top of story page)
- "CONNECT" → `/connect`

**Use Next.js Link component:**

```typescript
import Link from "next/link";
```

### 4. First-Time Visitor Modal

**Trigger Conditions:**

- ONLY when clicking "MY STORY" link
- ONLY if it's the user's first visit to the site
- Store visit status in localStorage

**Modal Design:**

```
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|   Welcome to Ray's Story! 🌱      |
|                                  |
|   Would you like to start from   |
|   the beginning?                 |
|                                  |
|   [Start from Beginning]         |
|   [Jump to Now]                  |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+
```

**Behavior:**

- "Start from Beginning" → Navigate to `/story#bottom`
- "Jump to Now" → Navigate to `/story#top`
- After first choice, never show again (set localStorage flag)
- Modal should be centered, with backdrop overlay
- Should work on mobile and desktop

**LocalStorage key:**

```typescript
const VISITED_KEY = "rays-garden-visited";
```

### 5. Story Page Scroll Behavior

**File:** `app/story/page.tsx`

**Structure:**

- Top section (id="top"): "NOW" - Current content
- Middle section: Story timeline/content
- Bottom section (id="bottom"): "The Beginning" - Origin story

**Scroll behavior:**

- When URL has `#top`: Scroll to top smoothly
- When URL has `#bottom`: Scroll to bottom smoothly
- Use `useEffect` to handle hash-based scrolling on mount

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Basic Navigation Component

**Step 1.1: Create Navigation File**

- Create `app/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Import Link from Next.js
- Create functional component structure
- Export default

**Step 1.2: Build Desktop Layout**

- Left section: RAY'S GARDEN link
- Right section: Three navigation links
- Use flexbox: `flex justify-between items-center`
- Add proper spacing and padding

**Step 1.3: Add Styling**

- Fixed positioning (top of screen)
- Backdrop blur background
- White text
- Hover effects
- z-index to stay above 3D scene

**Check-in:** Show me the navigation component, verify it looks good

---

### Phase 2: Add Mobile Responsiveness

**Step 2.1: Create Mobile State**

- Add useState for menu open/closed
- Add hamburger button (visible only on mobile)
- Hide desktop links on mobile with `hidden md:flex`

**Step 2.2: Mobile Menu**

- When hamburger clicked, toggle menu
- Show links vertically below nav bar
- Close menu when link is clicked
- Smooth transitions

**Check-in:** Test on mobile viewport, verify hamburger works

---

### Phase 3: Integrate Navigation with Home Page

**Step 3.1: Add to page.tsx**

- Import Navigation component
- Render above Garden component
- Ensure proper layering (Navigation above 3D scene)

**Code pattern:**

```typescript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navigation />
      <Garden />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Check-in:** Navigation appears over garden, links are clickable

---

### Phase 4: Create Story and Connect Pages

**Step 4.1: Create Story Page**

- Create `app/story/page.tsx`
- Add Navigation component
- Create three sections: top (NOW), middle (timeline), bottom (beginning)
- Add IDs for anchor linking
- Implement scroll-to-hash logic in useEffect

**Step 4.2: Create Connect Page**

- Create `app/connect/page.tsx`
- Add Navigation component
- Basic content structure
- Same background styling as story page

**Check-in:** All pages accessible, hash navigation works

---

### Phase 5: Implement First-Time Visitor Modal

**Step 5.1: Create Modal Component**

- Create `app/components/StoryModal.tsx`
- Props: isOpen, onClose, onStartFromBeginning, onJumpToNow
- Styled with backdrop overlay
- Centered modal box
- Two buttons with clear labels

**Modal styling:**

- Backdrop: Semi-transparent dark overlay
- Modal box: White or light background, rounded corners
- Centered on screen
- Good padding and spacing
- Accessible (can close with Escape key)

**Step 5.2: Add Modal Logic to Navigation**

- Check localStorage for visit status
- When "MY STORY" clicked:
  - If first visit: Show modal (prevent default navigation)
  - If returning: Navigate normally to `/story#bottom`
- When user makes choice: Set localStorage flag, navigate, close modal

**LocalStorage logic:**

```typescript
const hasVisited = localStorage.getItem("rays-garden-visited");
if (!hasVisited) {
  // Show modal
} else {
  // Navigate directly
}
```

**Step 5.3: Handle Modal Actions**

- "Start from Beginning":
  - Set visited flag
  - Navigate to `/story#bottom`
  - Close modal
- "Jump to Now":
  - Set visited flag
  - Navigate to `/story#top`
  - Close modal

**Check-in:** Modal appears on first MY STORY click, doesn't appear on subsequent visits

---

### Phase 6: Polish & Refinement

**Step 6.1: Smooth Transitions**

- Add fade-in animation to modal
- Smooth backdrop appearance
- Link hover transitions

**Step 6.2: Edge Cases**

- Test clearing localStorage (should show modal again)
- Test direct navigation to `/story` (should respect hash)
- Test mobile modal (should be responsive)

**Step 6.3: Final Styling**

- Ensure text is always readable
- Check all hover states
- Verify z-index layering is correct
- Test on different screen sizes

**Check-in:** Everything works smoothly, looks polished

## Component Code Structure

### Navigation.tsx Pattern

```typescript
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Navigation() {
  const [isMobileMenuOpen, setIsMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  const handleMyStoryClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    // Check first visit logic
    // Show modal if needed or navigate
  };

  return (
    <>
      <nav className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 px-8 py-6 bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md">
        {/* Desktop and mobile navigation */}
      </nav>

      {/* Modal component */}
      {showModal && <StoryModal ... />}
    </>
  );
}
```

### StoryModal.tsx Pattern

```typescript
interface StoryModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onStartFromBeginning: () => void;
  onJumpToNow: () => void;
}

export default function StoryModal({ ... }: StoryModalProps) {
  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center">
      {/* Backdrop */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm" />

      {/* Modal */}
      <div className="relative bg-white rounded-lg p-8 max-w-md">
        {/* Content */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Story Page Pattern

```typescript
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function StoryPage() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const hash = window.location.hash;
    if (hash === "#top") {
      window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" });
    } else if (hash === "#bottom") {
      window.scrollTo({ top: document.body.scrollHeight, behavior: "smooth" });
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <Navigation />
      <section id="top" className="min-h-screen pt-24">
        NOW content
      </section>
      <section className="min-h-screen">Timeline content</section>
      <section id="bottom" className="min-h-screen">
        Beginning content
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Design Notes

### Why Backdrop Blur Over Transparent

- **Readability:** The 3D garden has complex colors (pink sky, green ground, red lighthouse). Blur ensures text remains readable
- **Depth:** Creates visual hierarchy - navigation floats above the scene
- **Modern:** Glassmorphism is current and elegant
- **Flexible:** Works well regardless of what's behind it (day/night cycle, different scenes)

### Modal UX Reasoning

- Only show on first visit - don't be annoying
- Only for MY STORY - most users clicking NOW already know what they want
- Clear choice - two obvious buttons
- Remembers preference - respects user's time

---

## Important Notes

- **Use 'use client' directive** for components with state/effects
- **Next.js Link component** for all navigation (better performance)
- **localStorage** is browser-only - check if window exists
- **Smooth scrolling** enhances the experience
- **Mobile-first** approach for responsive design
- **z-index hierarchy:** Navigation (50) > Modal (50+) > Garden (default)
